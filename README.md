##  Project Overview

 This project applies Logistic Regression to predict whether a breast tumor
 is benign (0) or maligant (1) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin
 Dataset . The dataset was cleaned and normalized using StandrdScaler,
 and the model was trained with L1 regularization using Liblinear solver.
 

The model achieved "97% accuracy", with strong class-wise performance:

* Class 0 (Benign):** Precision = 0.97, Recall = 0.99, F1-score = 0.98
* Class 1 (Malignant):** Precision = 0.98, Recall = 0.95, F1-score = 0.97
* Macro Avg / Weighted Avg F1-score:** 0.97
